# Node API

This project is the foundation of a basic Node based API utilising JWT authentication.

I'm using the following

* Express
* Passport
* Helmet
* JWT
* MongoDb

## Setup

### Install the dependencies

`npm i`

### Profit

`node main.js`

> To keep the server running in the event of an unexpected error etc I recommend installing Nodemon globally `npm i -g nodemon` and then starting the server with `npm i -g nodemon`
